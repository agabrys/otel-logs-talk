# OpenTelemetry Logs Driving a Major Shift: Events, Richer Data, and Smarter Semantics

## whoami

I've traveled from the beautiful city of Krak√≥w (Cracow), where the pierogi are legendary and the WiFi is surprisingly good. You can find me lurking around GitHub as **pellared**, probably opening yet another pull request at 2 AM.

I'm a Software Engineer at Splunk (a company aquired by Cisco), which means I get paid for contributing to open source. I've been an OpenTelemetry Go maintainer a month or two before I foolishly volunteered to design OpenTelemetry Go Logs in November 2023. Apparently, someone thought I knew what I was doing.

I'm also an OpenTelemetry Specification sponsor, contributing to logs since January 2024, because clearly I don't have enough meetings in my life.

Fun fact: I'm apparently the 3rd top OpenTelemetry Contributor according to Linux Foundation Insights. I'm not sure if that's impressive or just means I need better hobbies.

I've been working with logs as one of the most important monitoring signals for almost 10 years now. Yes, that's a decade of my life spent deciphering cryptic error messages and wondering why developers think "something went wrong" is an acceptable log entry.

Disclaimer: I am not an English native speaker. But if something is not clear, don't blame my English. It simply means I have no idea whay I am talking about.
